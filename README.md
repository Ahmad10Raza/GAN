## About GANs

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of neural networks introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained in an adversarial manner. The generator aims to create data that is indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and fake data.

## Contents

This repository contains a wealth of information and resources related to GANs, including but not limited to:

- Detailed explanations of GAN concepts and principles.
- Various GAN architectures and their implementations.
- Hands-on tutorials and code examples.
- Datasets suitable for GAN training.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing GAN performance.
- Real-world applications and use cases of GANs.

Feel free to explore the repository's contents to learn more about GANs and how to use them effectively.
